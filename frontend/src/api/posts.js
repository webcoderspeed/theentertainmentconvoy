    "title": "A Look At The Unparalleled Brilliance Of Dilip Kumar, The First Superstar Of Indian Film Industry",
    "description": "Some actors don't need an introduction. Dilip Kumar was one such actor. The veteran star passed away today, at the age of 98, after a prolonged illness. \n Way before the likes of Rajesh Khanna, Amitabh Bachchan and Shahrukh Khan enjoyed the wave of super-stardom, Dilip Kumar had seen and done it all. Hailed as one of Bollywood's finest actors ever, Dilip Sa'ab was credited for bringing a sense of realism into Hindi film acting. Once described as the 'ultimate method actor' by none other than Satyajit Ray, Dilip Sa'ab was fondly addressed as the First Khan and Tragedy King by his fans. \n Starting out in the 1940s, Dilip Kumar went on to act in many blockbuster movies in his career spanning over six decades. What's most amazing about his career is that he was equally loved by the audiences as well as the critics. Not one to stick to a particular genre of cinema, Dilip Sa'ab excelled in every kind of performance. ",

    "title": "Ways To Deal With The Empty Feeling Called 'Languishing', While Stuck At Home",
    "description": "The Covid-19 pandemic has been going on for the better part of two years now and we have been stuck inside our homes for way too long. \n Sitting and stewing behind locked doors has led to a lot of us forming new habits, new ways of thinking, and new ways of perceiving things around us. \n One of the most common things that has happened during the lockdown is that many of us now feel a little ‘blah’ in our daily lives. \n And this feeling has a name. When the lockdown started, even though we were not all at the top of our game, a lot of us started new projects, welcomed the time-out to explore passions and hobbies, and saw the quarantine as an opportunity to become better.

    "title": "Our Thirst For Symmetrical Features Is Preventing Us From Being Comfortable In Our Skin",
    "description": "For hundreds of years, our ideas of beauty have been based on Eurocentric ideals, and this includes modern-day ideas of “perfection” in terms of physical attributes. A major part of this is symmetry, which has been touted as one of the chief “must haves” for someone to be considered “beautiful” per social standards. And those who do not have symmetrical features are often treated as oddities. It doesn’t take a genius to see why this is problematic. \n It all started with Leonardo Da Vinci’s “golden ratio”. \n This view of anatomy, called the ‘Golden Ratio’, was heavily influenced by concepts of symmetry, as it denoted just how much space there would be between each feature for a true-to-life representation of a human figure in visual art. What this means, in lay people terms, is that in the “perfect” face or body, the eyes have to be a certain size vis a vis the jaw, and the nose and lips have to have a certain distance from each other in order to be considered beautiful, or ideal. This was meant to help create paintings of the human body that are “aesthetically pleasing. \n Today, years later, these ideas remain, but are applied to actual humans, instead of paintings. As a result, we think of smaller eyes, different eyebrows, uneven breasts and asymmetrical eyes as abnormalities, even going so far as to mock people who have them.",
